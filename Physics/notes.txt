Improving numerical precision:
- RK4
- adaptive steps
- Richardson Extrapolation and the Bulirsch-Stoer Method
- ???
Improving performance:
- real space partitioning (k-d trees?)
- using threads (real multicore threading)
- using OpenCL/CUDA
Problems:
- Collisions should be detected in time not when already should've happened
